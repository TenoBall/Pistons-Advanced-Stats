Assessing the Pistons roster to see who I think could be viable trade/re-sign candidates  

## Early Notes  
I'm really puzzled by Ausar Thompson being a high-minutes (30+) on a successful playoff team.  

-He plays limited minutes now; 6th on the team in minutes per game. Fully understand that teams are distributing more minutes now tham ever before. But this gets tighter in the playoffs (data to support?)  
-He cannot shoot whatsoever. So, I wonder what his role is during the fourth quarter of a playoff game.  
-There has been interesting plus/minus numbers in early Jan 2025 games plus further questionable on/off stats. Will look to confirm/debunk these a bit.  

Beyond Ausar's limitations, Ron Holland and Jaden Ivey are quite duplicative as young wings, primarily Ron Holland as a defense-first wing.
